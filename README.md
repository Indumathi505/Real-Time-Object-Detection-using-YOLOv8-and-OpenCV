# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model from the Ultralytics library. The implementation covers image detection and video detection using OpenCV, with custom label coloring and confidence score display.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- ✅ Model checking and setup using `ultralytics.checks()`
- 📸 Object detection on images with bounding boxes and class labels
- 🎥 Real-time object detection on video files using OpenCV
- 🏷️ Custom class label mapping from COCO dataset
- 🎨 Random color generation for each object class for better visualization
